        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I never imagined myself in tech. If you'd told younger me I'd have a Software Engineering degree one day, I'd have laughed. But life never goes to plan– and my journey into software development began unexpectedly at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), where I started as an Administrative Coordinator supporting the Research Computing Division.

          Surrounded by brilliant software engineers watching them create something out of nothing seemed like actual magic. I started exploring low-code platforms like Microsoft Power Apps and Power Automate to automate tedious administrative tasks. What began as curiosity about "how can I make this a little easier?" turned into hours of YouTube tutorials and hands-on experimentation.

          With encouragement from my managers, peers, and my partner, I took a leap into something completely new and foreign to me and fell in love with it. Nearly four years later, with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering from WGU, I've progressed to delivering production software solutions. Now I'm ready to make magic every day!

          When I'm not coding, you'll find me as a self-identified "indoorsy" person diving into fantasy and horror novels, binge-watching anime, creating art, and gaming.
